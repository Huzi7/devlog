- [x] test out dynamic adding of version variable
- [x] add build step to modify version that is shipped as a binary in circleci
- [x] test gorelease build locally to make sure it sets the version correctly. Make sure to set the env var first.
- [x] add a new tag and release that includes version.
- [ ] fix bug with version tag being one version behind e.g. v0.0.20 is latest but its showing v0.0.19
